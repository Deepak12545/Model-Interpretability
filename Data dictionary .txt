Data:

● The data shared has 8 lakh rows of sessions happened on UC customer app. From Dec 17,2018 to Jan 30,2019
● These are the sessions landed on the UC slots page. (This is the page where we ask customer to select booking time preference)
● Our hypothesis is conversion from slots page to request placed is dependent on 1) category 2) day of week 3) no of slots shown to customer

Column Definitions:
Record_id	Session Id of Customer visit. All visits by customer in a 30 min slot in a category is one record_id
City_key	City of customer
Event_time	Time of visit on slot page
Weekday	Weekday of event time
Category_key	Category of visit
Rptcatg	Supercategory of visit
Req_id	If session has placed request then req_id else blank

Session_group	4 digits (d0_possible,d0_group,d1_group,d2_group)
•	D0 – Same day as day of visit
•	D1 – Next day from day of visit
•	D2 – Next to next day from day of visit



Detailed explanation of session group:
Day is categorized into following slots
● 0-10 hours
● 10-12 hours
● 12-15 hours
● 15-18 hours
● 18-20 hours
● 20+ hours

To simplify further Slots shown in a day are counted as a variable with 4 possible values
● 0 (No slots shown)
● 1 (1 Slot shown )
● 2 (2 or 3 slots shown)
● 3 (4 or 5 or 6 slots shown)
Our understanding is if everything is same, all sessions of a given session group have similar conversion.

For Ex: session group is 2123 then (d0_possible=2 , d0_group=1 , d1_group=2, d2_group=3)

D0_possible = Slot configuration possible in D0 (possible values 0,1,2,3 as explained above). If we open all slots in D0 this is what we get)
D0_group = Slot configuration shown for D0
D1_group = Slot configuration shown for D1
D2_group = slot configuration shown for D2
*Note : D1_possible and D2_possible are always 3.

So for this user if UC showed all slots then possible configuration could be 2233
